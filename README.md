# mergesort_ranker

My preferred method for sorting lists by user preference. A potentially more accurate albeit much slower method is Elo Sort.

## Running

Run this command in the terminal; admin privileges are not required:

```
python mergesort.py item1 item2 item3 ...
```

The script takes the items for comparison as arguments upon execution. A theoretical infinite amount of items are allowed to be taken as arguments, but massive amounts of items will take computational power to sort as well as a longer time for the user to rank.
